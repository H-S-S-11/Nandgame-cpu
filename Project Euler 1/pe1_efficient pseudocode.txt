--The benchmark to beat is 11,000 cycles to get the answer
--The correct answer, 0x090E, was obtained in 795 cycles (first time!)

--J extension: this required more debugging and a slight code rewrite, but eventually the correct answer was obtained in 690 cycles
--this shows a slight improvement as expected

store jump address in a reg
copy a to j
(test_num loop 1 start)
load RAM(0) to data
add: data+RAM(1) to RAM(1)
add: data+3 to data
store data to RAM(0)
subtract: data-100 to data, loop if data<0

store 0 in RAM(0)

store jump address in a reg
copy a to j
